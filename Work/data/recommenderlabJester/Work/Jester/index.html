Anonymous Ratings Data from <br>
the <a href="http://shadow.ieor.berkeley.edu/humor/">
Jester</a> Online Joke Recommender System
</h2>

Collaborative Filtering Data:
<p>

4.1 Million continuous ratings (-10.00 to +10.00) of 100 jokes from 73,421 users:
collected between April 1999 - May 2003.  <p>

Freely available for research use when acknowledged with the following reference: <p>

<p>

(Aside: many papers, including ours, report Normalized Mean Absolute
Error (NMAE) rates of approx 20%. How good is this compared with
random guessing?  In the Appendix to our paper, we show that if user
ratings are uniformly distributed, random guessing yields NMAE =
33%.)

As a courtesy, if you use the data, 
I would appreciate knowing your name, what research group
you are in, and the publications that may result.


<p>
The Jester Dataset  (save to disk, then unzip to obtain Excel files):

<ul>
<li><a href="jester-data-1.zip"> jester-data-1.zip </a>: (3.9MB) Data from
24,983 users who have rated 36 or more jokes, a matrix with dimensions
24983 X 101.

<li><a href="jester-data-2.zip"> jester-data-2.zip </a>: (3.6MB) Data
from 23,500 users who have rated 36 or more jokes, a matrix with
dimensions 23500 X 101.

<li><a href="jester-data-3.zip"> jester-data-3.zip </a>: (2.1MB) Data
from 24,938 users who have rated between 15 and 35 jokes, a matrix
with dimensions 24,938 X 101.

</ul>


<p>
Format:
<ol>
<li>3 Data files contain anonymous ratings data from 73,421 users. 

<li>Data files are in .zip format, when unzipped, they are in Excel (.xls) format 

<li>Ratings are real values ranging from -10.00 to +10.00
(the value "99" corresponds to "null" = "not rated").

<li>One row per user

<li>The first column gives the number of jokes rated by that user.
   The next 100 columns give the ratings for jokes 01 - 100.

<li>The sub-matrix including only columns 
{5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20} is dense.
Almost all users have rated those jokes (see discussion
of "universal queries" in the above paper).

</ol>
